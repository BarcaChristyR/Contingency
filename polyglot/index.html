		<p>Once upon a time, there was a polyglot named <b>Ivan</b> who lived in South Africa. Ivan was originally from Russia and had an incredible gift for languages. He could speak <i>English, Afrikaans, Zulu, and even Russian fluently</i>, which was quite impressive considering he lived in South Africa.

			One day, Ivan was out walking in a local park when he came across a group of tourists who were huddled together, looking at a map with a perplexed expression on their faces. Ivan, being the helpful and friendly person he was, approached the group and asked if he could assist them.

			The tourists were surprised to hear someone speaking <i>Russian</i> in the heart of South Africa. Ivan explained that he was a polyglot and could speak several languages fluently, including Russian. The tourists were impressed and grateful for Ivan's help.

			<br><br>As Ivan led the group of tourists through the park, he began telling them stories about his travels around the world. The tourists were captivated by Ivan's stories and his ability to speak multiple languages, and they laughed at his jokes in Russian.

			At one point, Ivan spotted a family having a picnic and decided to introduce the tourists to some of the local customs. He explained that it was customary in South Africa to greet people in their native language, so he taught them a few phrases in Zulu.

			The tourists were eager to try out their new language skills, and they eagerly greeted the family in Zulu. The family looked at them with surprise and then burst out laughing when they realized that the tourists were not locals, but rather foreigners attempting to speak their language.

			Ivan couldn't help but laugh at the situation, and the tourists joined in, realizing the humor in their mistake. From that moment on, the tourists became more relaxed around Ivan and enjoyed themselves immensely.

			<br><br>As they continued their tour of the park, Ivan pointed out various wildlife and taught the tourists more phrases in different languages. They even tried to spot the elusive Cape Buffalo that was known to roam the area.

			As the day came to an end, the tourists thanked Ivan for his help and his humor, and they all parted ways with big smiles on their faces. Ivan went home that day feeling happy and fulfilled, knowing that he had made a difference in the lives of those tourists and had created some great memories along the way.
